# teaching
After completing my F.Sc I joined a private school as a primary teacher. Before starting this profession I used to be a home tutor at my house where I used to teach bio, chemistry, physics, and mathematics. Teaching was not merely my vocation it was also my zest and I was willing to educate matriculation learners which is also called secondary school certificate (SSC) in an academy. Unfortunately, my qualifications didnâ€™t meet the criteria to coach Secondary students, so I initiated with primary school.
 Work hard and success
I drudged very hard. My travail and luck boosted so swiftly
